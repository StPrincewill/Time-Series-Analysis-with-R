# Time-Series-Analysis-with-R

Welland_Rain.csv contains total precipitation by month for the city of Welland. The dates covered are January 1995 to October 2004.

Waterloo_Precip.csv contained total precipitation for Waterloo for the years 1950 to 2005.

Both datasets have been retrieved from Environment Canada from data generated by local weather stations.

I will be using basic time series analysis to describe and forecast precipitation for these two areas.
